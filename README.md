Advent of Code
==============
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of
skill levels. It is good for both beginners who are first learning and
even for experts who need to keep their skills sharp.

What is this repository?
------------------------
This repository includes *solutions* to the problems for Advent of Code.
I am including the solutions with detailed comments here to help see how
a professional software developer may go about solving these problems.

*Before looking at the answers, try to find the solution yourself.*

Learning how to code is all about making mistakes, banging your head in
frustration, and perserverance. But learning how to code is also about
learning from others, which is why there are solutions in here.

What language should I use?
---------------------------
You should use either Python or Ruby. Solutions for both have been
included here. If you have never used either of these languages, spend
some time on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) learning either
one.

Don't worry about choosing the wrong language.  Programming languages
are all very similar to each other and once you have learned a few, it
is very easy to pick up a new language. You cannot choose a wrong
language.

How is this repository structured?
----------------------------------
The repository has a folder for each day and a README.md describing the
problem. The scripts are written in a way that you can answer both the
initial problem and the expanded problem.

The Python solution has a `.py` extension while the Ruby solution has a
`.rb` extension.

There is an `input.txt` file in every directory. This is the input *I*
received when solving the problem. It is included just to show how the
program works.
